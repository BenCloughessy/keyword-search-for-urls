# Utility Tool
I built this tool to help in my job search, but I imagine it could have many functions.
In my use case, I wanted to look for job openings for developers at homeless shelters in the US. The task was going to be monumental, so I used TomTom poi search API to return lists of websites related to any search term and then filter them to ensure high quality of information.

# Redundant?
I recognize there are other, better, tools for accomplishing such a task. But there's nothing quite like building it yourself, you know? Anyways, I enjoy the simplicity.
